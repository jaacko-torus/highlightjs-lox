# Demo

Here are some demos if you are struggling to put this plugin to use.

## [`client/es5`](client/es5/index.html)

Uses the [`iife`](../dist/iife/lox.js) module syntax. It's the one I recommend for pre-es-module builds. Simple import, simple use.

## [`client/es6`](client/es6/main.js)

If you want to use [`es6`](../dist/es/lox.js) modules then there's an export for that.

## [`server`](server/src/app.js)

Finally, in case you are using it in Node, and don't want to use `"type": "module"` nor compile your code, then there's a [`cjs`](../dist/cjs/lox.js) export also.
